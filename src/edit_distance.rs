//! Compute the edit distance between two strings

/// strings. This edit distance is defined as being 1 point per insertion,
/// substitution, or deletion which must be made to make the strings equal.

/// I adapted this function from one I found in the
/// [TheAlgorithms/Rust repo on Github](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Rust/blob/master/src/dynamic_programming/edit_distance.rs).

/// Instead of storing the `m * n` matrix expicitly, only one row (of length `n`) is stored.
/// It keeps overwriting itself based on its previous values with the help of two scalars,
/// gradually reaching the last row. Then, the score is `matrix[n]`.
